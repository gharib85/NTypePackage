Welcome to NTypeCQED's documentation!
=====================================

This is the simulation framework accompaning the `paper <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-018-0181-1>`_.
All simulations and theory comparisons presented in the paper were performed with this software.

Below is the simplified level scheme with all transitions, detuning and decays that are considered in the simulation.
