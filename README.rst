NTypePackage
============

This is the accompanying simulation source code for the paper *to be published, link will be inserted*.
This Python package is meant as a convenience layer for the underlying `QuTiP <http://qutip.org/>`_ to get our readers
started in doing own simulations in this interesting level scheme.


For more information and details about the physics behind it please refer to the paper and especially to
the supplementary information provided with it.

To get started with the simulation framework please visit the docs *link here to docs*.
